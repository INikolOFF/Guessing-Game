Purpose of this project
It is designed as practice for beginners, helping them understand:
	•	how to use functions
	•	how to work with lists
	•	handling user input
	•	using loops and conditional statements
	•	structuring a small Python project

The code is commented and easy to follow.

  Future improvements (optional ideas)
✓	•	Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
✓	•	Add a scoring system based on attempts
✓	•	Add time tracking for each game
	•	Save game statistics to a file
	•	Add colored terminal output
	   


A simple interactive game where the player has to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. 

## Features

- Get hints if the number is even or odd
- Keep track of all previous attempts
- Shows how far your last guess is from the secret number (new feature)
- Interactive console-based gameplay
- Add a scoring system based on attempts
- After each guess, it checks whether the player is getting closer or further away
- 11:13 PMGuess history - Shows all previous attempts with proximity indicators
- Proximity hints - Dynamic feedback based on distance to target number
- Persistent statistics - Best scores saved to file across sessions
- Duplicate prevention - Warns if you try the same number twice
- Enhanced UI - Color-coded feedback, improved fonts and button styling
- Better notifications - Detailed win messages and record tracking  


## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your guess.
3. Type \`0\` if you want a hint.
4. Keep guessing until you find the secret number.

	•	Three difficulty levels: Easy (1–50), Medium (1–100), Hard (1–200)
	•	Dynamic hints: “Very close!”, “Close!”, “Go much higher/lower!”
	•	Guess history: shows last 8 guesses with “…” if more
	•	Tracks best scores per difficulty with trophy notification
	•	Input validation to prevent invalid numbers
	•	Disables input/buttons after winning
