Purpose of this project

This game is intentionally simple.
It is designed as practice for beginners, helping them understand:
	•	how to use functions
	•	how to work with lists
	•	handling user input
	•	using loops and conditional statements
	•	structuring a small Python project

The code is commented and easy to follow.

  Future improvements (optional ideas)
	•	Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
	•	Add a scoring system based on attempts
	•	Add time tracking for each game
	•	Save game statistics to a file
	•	Add colored terminal output
